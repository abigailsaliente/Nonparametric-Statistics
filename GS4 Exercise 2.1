#Exercise 2.1
#One sample run test
#create a vector

b <- c("O","O","O","E","E","E","E","O","O","O","O","O","E","E","E","E",
       "O","O","E","E","E","E","O","O","O","O","E","E","E","E","O","O")
RunsTest(b)



          Runs Test for Randomness

data:  b
z = -2.6955, runs = 9, m = 16, n = 16, p-value = 0.007029
alternative hypothesis: true number of runs is not equal the expected number
