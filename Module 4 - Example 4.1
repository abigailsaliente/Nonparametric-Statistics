Results of Hypothesis Test
--------------------------

Null Hypothesis:                 median of differences = 0

Alternative Hypothesis:          True median of differences is greater than 0

Test Name:                       Paired Sign test

Estimated Parameter(s):          median of differences = 14.5

Data:                            x = before
                                 y = after 

Test Statistic:                  # Diffs > median of differences = 9

P-value:                         0.01074219
