Results of Hypothesis Test
--------------------------

Null Hypothesis:                 median of differences = 0

Alternative Hypothesis:          True median of differences is less than 0

Test Name:                       Paired Sign test

Estimated Parameter(s):          median of differences = 1

Data:                            x = before
                                 y = after 

Test Statistic:                  # Diffs > median of differences = 14

P-value:                         0.7878219

Confidence Interval for:         median of differences

Confidence Interval Method:      interpolate (Nyblom, 1992)

Confidence Interval Type:        upper

Confidence Level:                5%

Confidence Limit Rank(s):        NA NA 9 8 

Confidence Interval:             LCL =      -Inf
                                 UCL = -1.060436
